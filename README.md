_Based on [taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate)_

## Installation

Just download this repository, as this is a boilerplate and not something you want to base your git on.

After download, `cd` inside and do: 

```bash
npm install

# OR

yarn add
```

## Usage

### Development server

```bash
npm start
```

You can view the development server at `localhost:8080`.

### Production build

```bash

```

> Note: Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) globally to deploy a simple server.

You can view the deploy by creating a server in `dist`. 

```bash
cd dist && http-server
```
